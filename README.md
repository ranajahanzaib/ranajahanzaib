Hey ðŸ‘‹
======

I'm a lead developer and author at [Spexware](https://spexware.com), a data-driven platform that focuses on tech specs of electronic devices. Previously, I was working at [Appzaib](https://github.com/appzaib). I have always loved spending way too much time on computer, and in doing so I have built a passion for writing software that scale and [designing websites](https://ranajahanzaib.com/design) that work. Around 70% of the time you'll find me working on Upwork as a [freelance developer](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01bbcf6edb91a8df5f/), or contributing to open source software on GitHub. But when I'm not coding, I'm most likely out, [playing PUBG Mobile](https://ranajahanzaib.com/play/pubg-mobile) or watching [TV Series](https://ranajahanzaib.com/reviews/tv-series) on Netflix.
